The shelves hold the chapters of a life—past loves, enduring passions, vanquished whims, unrealized ambitions. The unread books are not failures of intention but promises. They are talismans. They represent the reader I aspire to be and the person I hope to become. If I read all the books I own, I’d lose the charm of imagining what it would feel like to read them.",

    "text": "The weight of language lies in its ordering. Every word, every signifier, carries a multiplicity of meanings, a potential that expands or contracts depending on its placement. To organize language—whether into a sentence, a library, or a list—is to impose a structure, but also to unlock new possibilities. In a library or a list, the universe is reshuffled, alphabetized, and cataloged for a different kind of reading. Each system of order is a lens, a way of looking at the infinite and saying: Here, in this moment, I choose to see it this way. Language, when ordered, is both a cage and a key.",

    "text": "Tsundoku (積ん読) is the phenomenon of acquiring reading materials but letting them pile up in one's home without reading them. The term is also used to refer to books ready for reading later when they are on a bookshelf.  The term originated in the Meiji era (1868–1912) as Japanese slang. It combines elements of the terms tsunde-oku (積んでおく, \"to pile things up ready for later and leave\"), and dokusho (読書, \"reading books\"). There are suggestions to use the word in the English language and include it in dictionaries like the Collins Dictionary.",
