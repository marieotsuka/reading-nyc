In any case they are never envisaged as depending on causes that can be uncovered by careful analysis and turned to account.",

			"text": "Zaira, a city of memory. Its streets, its buildings, its squares, are made of stories. These stories do not correspond to the way the city actually looks or functions in the present moment, but to the impressions, the images, the expectations, and the hopes of those who have passed through it or thought about it.<br><br>Zaira is a city that looks different depending on who is looking at it. One traveler might see its narrow streets and alleys as pathways to adventure; another might look at the same places and feel the weight of time, of loss, of things that have disappeared or never existed. The city is composed of these different viewpoints, and it is in the intersection of these impressions that it truly exists.<br><br>In Zaira, there are no real streets, no real places. There are only memories—each building is a recollection, each square a dream. As you walk through the city, you’re not so much walking through space as you are walking through time. The street in front of you is an imaginary path; the buildings you pass are fleeting symbols, ephemeral and delicate. There are no true edges to the city, no fixed boundaries; there is only the blurred horizon of memory.<br><br>Zaira has no topography, no clear map. People live in Zaira by creating their own paths, by marking their own landmarks and landmarks that are linked to their own experiences of the city. To live in Zaira is to perpetually reread the city, to reinterpret it according to one’s own stories and histories.<br><br>The traveler who comes to Zaira is faced with the challenge of navigating not the physical space, but the memory-laden landscape of the mind. To understand Zaira, one must not just walk through its streets but listen to its past, to its echoes. The city only makes sense when it is read as a story, when its buildings and streets are no longer seen as objects but as symbols of what has been and what might yet be.",
